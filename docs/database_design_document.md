## Design Rationale

### Making Sense of the Money Moves

Imagine our database is like a well-organized office that tracks every mobile money transaction. We've created different filing cabinets (tables) for different types of information so that everything has its place and is easy to find.

**Users Cabinet**: This is our address book. It holds the essential info for every customer—their unique phone number, name, and account status. The user_id is like giving each person their own employee ID number; it's a simple, unique way to identify them across our entire system.

**Transactions Cabinet**: The heart of our operation. Every time money is sent or received, we file a record here. But instead of writing out the sender's and receiver's full details every single time, we simply write down their user_id (like referencing their employee ID). This creates a smart, efficient link back to the Users cabinet. We do the same thing for the category_id and message_id, which point to their own specialized cabinets. This prevents duplicate information and keeps everything consistent. The reference_number acts as a unique tracking number for each transaction, much like a receipt number.

**Transaction_Categories Cabinet**: Our rulebook. It helps us understand the type of each transaction, like "cash deposit," "bill payment," or "money transfer." Each category can have its own rule pattern, which is like a set of instructions for our system on how to handle that specific kind of transaction.

**Raw_Messages Cabinet**: Our "Inbox." It stores the original, unedited text messages (SMS) that come in from the telecom network before our system translates them. Once a message is processed, we update its status and timestamp it.

**System_Logs Cabinet**: Our security guard and secretary. It keeps a detailed diary of everything that happens in our system—successes, errors, and warnings. This is crucial for troubleshooting problems and maintaining a clear audit trail.

### Technical Justification

This ERD design prioritizes data integrity and query performance for MoMo SMS transaction analysis. The core `TRANSACTIONS` table centralizes all financial data with proper normalization, separating user information into a dedicated `USERS` table to avoid redundancy and enable user-based analytics.

The `TRANSACTION_CATEGORIES` table supports flexible transaction classification through rule-based patterns, allowing the system to automatically categorize transactions based on SMS content analysis. The `RAW_MESSAGES` table preserves original SMS data for audit trails and reprocessing capabilities.

Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity, while strategic indexes on frequently queried columns (timestamp, phone numbers, status) optimize performance. The `SYSTEM_LOGS` table with JSON context enables comprehensive debugging and monitoring of the ETL pipeline.

This design supports both operational queries (transaction lookups, user history) and analytical queries (aggregate reports, trend analysis) while maintaining data consistency and supporting future scalability requirements.

## Sample Queries

### 1. User Transaction History
```sql
SELECT t.transaction_id, t.amount, t.currency, t.transaction_type, t.status, t.timestamp,
       u_sender.full_name as sender_name, u_receiver.full_name as receiver_name,
       tc.category_name
FROM Transactions t
LEFT JOIN Users u_sender ON t.sender_id = u_sender.user_id
LEFT JOIN Users u_receiver ON t.receiver_id = u_receiver.user_id
JOIN Transaction_Categories tc ON t.category_id = tc.category_id
WHERE t.sender_id = 1 OR t.receiver_id = 1
ORDER BY t.timestamp DESC;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Transaction ID: 1, Amount: 5000.00 RWF, Type: receive, Status: completed
- Sender: Manzi Arnold, Receiver: Kevin Nizeyimana, Category: Transfer

### 2. Transaction Summary by Category
```sql
SELECT tc.category_name, COUNT(*) as transaction_count, 
       SUM(t.amount) as total_amount, AVG(t.amount) as avg_amount
FROM Transactions t
JOIN Transaction_Categories tc ON t.category_id = tc.category_id
WHERE t.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY tc.category_id, tc.category_name
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Transfer: 3 transactions, 15,500.00 RWF total, 5,166.67 RWF average
- Withdrawal: 1 transaction, 10,000.00 RWF total, 10,000.00 RWF average
- Payment: 3 transactions, 8,700.00 RWF total, 2,900.00 RWF average

### 3. Daily Transaction Volume
```sql
SELECT DATE(timestamp) as transaction_date,
       COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
       SUM(amount) as total_volume,
       AVG(amount) as avg_transaction_amount
FROM Transactions
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC;
```

**Expected Results:**
- 2024-01-15: 6 transactions, 30,200.00 RWF total, 5,033.33 RWF average
- 2024-01-16: 2 transactions, 8,700.00 RWF total, 4,350.00 RWF average

### 4. User Activity Summary
```sql
SELECT u.full_name, u.phone_number,
       COUNT(t.transaction_id) as total_transactions,
       SUM(CASE WHEN t.sender_id = u.user_id THEN t.amount ELSE 0 END) as total_sent,

## Security and Accuracy Rules

### 1. Data Integrity Constraints

#### Amount Validation
```sql
CHECK (amount >= 0)
```
**Purpose**: Ensures no negative transaction amounts
**Screenshot Required**: Show constraint creation and violation attempt

#### Currency Validation
```sql
CHECK (currency IN ('RWF', 'USD', 'EUR', 'UGX', 'TZS', 'KES'))
```
**Purpose**: Restricts currency to supported East African currencies
**Screenshot Required**: Show constraint creation and invalid currency rejection

#### Sender-Receiver Validation
```sql
CONSTRAINT chk_sender_receiver CHECK (sender_id != receiver_id OR sender_id IS NULL OR receiver_id IS NULL)
```
**Purpose**: Prevents users from sending money to themselves
**Screenshot Required**: Show constraint creation and self-transaction rejection

### 2. Referential Integrity

#### Foreign Key Constraints
- `sender_id` → `Users.user_id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- `receiver_id` → `Users.user_id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- `category_id` → `Transaction_Categories.category_id` (ON DELETE RESTRICT)
- `message_id` → `Raw_Messages.message_id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)

**Purpose**: Maintains data consistency across related tables
**Screenshot Required**: Show foreign key creation and cascade behavior

### 3. Unique Constraints

#### Phone Number Uniqueness
```sql
UNIQUE (phone_number)
```
**Purpose**: Ensures each phone number can only have one account
**Screenshot Required**: Show unique constraint creation and duplicate rejection

#### Reference Number Uniqueness
```sql
UNIQUE (reference_number)
```
**Purpose**: Ensures each transaction has a unique reference number
**Screenshot Required**: Show unique constraint creation and duplicate rejection

### 4. Performance Optimization

#### Strategic Indexes
- `idx_transactions_timestamp` - For time-based queries
- `idx_transactions_sender` - For user transaction lookups
- `idx_transactions_receiver` - For user transaction lookups
- `idx_transactions_category` - For category-based analysis
- `idx_users_phone` - For phone number lookups

**Purpose**: Optimizes query performance for common operations
**Screenshot Required**: Show index creation and query execution plans
